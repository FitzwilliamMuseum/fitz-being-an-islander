Being an Islander project is co-organising a three-day international, interdisciplinary conference with the Ashmolean Museum, and Dr Andrew Shapland in particular, to be held in late March 2023 in London, Cambridge and Oxford.

The two institutions joined forces, prompted by the fact that they are planning two major exhibitions in 2023 in Cambridge and Oxford, on the theme of the Mediterranean islands, which dovetail common research questions in their respective research projects.

The conference will include keynote lectures from leading researchers in the fields of Mediterranean Archaeology, Island Archaeology, the Archaeology of Crete and Knossos, as well as neighbouring scientific fields (archaeobotany, archaeometallurgy, ceramic studies) in dialogue with the broader disciplines above.

Details of the conferenceâ€™s place and date, as well as a preliminary programme, will be published here soon, as well as on the research pages of the Ashmolean Museum's Antiquities Department
