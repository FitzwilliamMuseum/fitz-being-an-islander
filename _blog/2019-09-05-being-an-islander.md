The Fitzwilliam Museum announces an exciting new dimension to the research and exhibition project ***‘Being an Islander’: Art and Identity of the Large Mediterranean Islands***, a four-year project aiming to elucidate what defines island identity in the Mediterranean. Research (2019-2023) is conducted by a team of curators, researchers, conservators, learning, engagement and digital specialists, enhanced by contemporary artists and invited specialists from a variety of European and American research institutions, universities and museums.

The project culminates with a major exhibition in February 2023- June 2023 at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge in partnership with the Ministries of Culture in Greece and Italy, as well as the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works of Cyprus (Department of Antiquities, Cyprus).

Over four years the project will produce a legacy of new research, publications and conferences, an inclusive and diverse public programme as well as a large-scale exhibition.

A new initiative funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation includes the production of a documentary centred on the Mediterranean Sea, a programme exploring issues of migration and mobility in the Mediterranean past and present, several digital initiatives (e.g., a Google Arts & Culture Exhibit, a virtual reality (VR/XR) installation) as well as a formal learning programme for families, young audiences and disability groups. The programme is under the auspices of the Embassy of Greece and the High Commission of Cyprus in the United Kingdom, incorporating strategic partnerships with the Hellenic diaspora communities.

The Fitzwilliam Museum expresses its deep gratitude to the Stavros Niarchos Foundation for this award and is delighted to be part of the community of projects and institutions supported by the Foundation.
