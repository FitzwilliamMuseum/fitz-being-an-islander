Islanders: The Making of the Mediterranean is a major exhibition coming to Fitzwilliam Museum between 24 February 2023 and the 4 June 2023. The exhibition is the result of the longstanding research project desccribed in these pages (‘Being an Islander: Art and Identity of the Large Mediterranean Islands’, 2019-2023) which together with a corresponding public engagement programme aims to elucidate island identities in the Mediterranean. Together, they explore how ‘insularity’– being of an island, affected and shaped art production and creativity, architectural evolution, migrations and movement of people, using Crete, Cyprus and Sardinia as case studies. The exhibition extends beyond the topic of the ancient Mediterranean, incorporating current discourses on island versus mainland cultural identities, including Britain’s own, debated island identity.

Through key artefacts and interactive installations, including a virtual reality installation bringing an ancient settlement alive for our audiences to explore, the exhibition invites us to think of the Mediterranean islands and the sea that surrounds them, in terms of connectivity and mobility rather than modern political boundaries. 180 unique archaeological objects, most never displayed before outside Cyprus, Crete and Sardinia tell exceptional stories of insular identity, over a period of 3000 years.
