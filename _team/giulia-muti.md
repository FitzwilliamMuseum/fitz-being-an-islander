Giulia Muti is an archaeologist specialising in textile production with a focus on prehistoric Cyprus. In addition to textiles, her interests include ceramics, island archaeology, experimental and experiential archaeology, gender studies and New Materialisms. Giulia received a BA in Cultural Heritage and a MA in Archaeology and Ancient History from the Italian universities of Pisa and Torino. She moved to the UK in 2016 to start her PhD in Archaeology at the University of Manchester, successfully obtained in 2020. Her PhD thesis entitled ‘Tracing Ancient Textiles: Production, Consumption and Social Uses in Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Cyprus (c. 2800-1450 BC)’ represents the first holistic study of textile production in Cypriot late prehistory.

Giulia is passionate about fieldwork, and she has participated in different archaeological projects in Italy and Cyprus. She holds the role of lab supervisor for the processing of archaeological material – including pottery, metal, ground stone and small finds – in the Erimi Archaeological Project (directed by Prof L. Bombardieri), and she is a trench supervisor and textile specialist for the archaeological excavation at Kissonerga Skalia (directed by Dr L. Crewe). She is also trained in experimental archaeology on Bronze Age spinning and weaving. In 2018, she designed and co-organised the international postgraduate conference ‘Islands in Dialogue (ISLANDIA)’, which discussed the multifaceted insular identities in the Mediterranean.
