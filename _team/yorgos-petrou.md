Yorgos Petrou is a Cypriot born, London based visual artist whose practice spans sculpture, performance, photography, film, and writing. His politically subtle and layered approach to art-making aims to transform theory, reading and understanding into materials that travel freely between the pieces. His work investigates the relationships between body, object, and land to query hierarchies of value and knowledge. He often engages with the liminal space between Europe, Asia, and Africa and their shared colonial histories by looking at stains and remains on peoples and land, focussing on the archaeological - often fragmented - body as it exists within the earth. He trained at the Royal College of Art and Chelsea College of Art and Design, London, UK.
