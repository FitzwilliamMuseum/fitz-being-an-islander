Professor Martinón-Torres academic background includes degrees in history, archaeology and archaeological science. Their combination is a recurrent thread in my work.

Much of his research has focused on the analysis of material culture and the reverse engineering of archaeological technologies, as a starting point to understand the evolution and movement of knowledge, people and things. Working with a large number international research students and postdoctoral fellows has massively broadened his horizons. Marcos is very fond of collaborative and exploratory research, and greatly enjoys teaching.

 Professor Martinón-Torres joined the Department of Archaeology in Cambridge in 2018, after over a decade at UCL. He is very excited about the new challenges, synergies and opportunities that this will bring.
