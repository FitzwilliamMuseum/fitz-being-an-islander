My academic background includes degrees in history, archaeology and archaeological science. Their combination is a recurrent thread in my work.

Much of my research has focused on the analysis of material culture and the reverse engineering of archaeological technologies, as a starting point to understand the evolution and movement of knowledge, people and things. Working with a large number international research students and postdoctoral fellows has massively broadened my horizons. I am very fond of collaborative and exploratory research, and greatly enjoy teaching.

I joined the Department of Archaeology in Cambridge in 2018, after over decade at UCL. I am very excited about the new challenges, synergies and opportunities that this will bring.
