Ema was a research associate for the Being an Islander research and exhibition project between January 2020 and August 2021. She conducted scientific analysis of metal objects from Cyprus held in the Fitzwilliam Museum collection, aiming to reconstruct their production technologies. Ema specialises in ancient metallurgy with a particular interest in technological processes and sociocultural implications of metal production and use in the past. Prior to joining the ‘Being an Islander’ team, she completed her PhD at Aarhus University, Denmark, where she carried out research into East African iron production processes and trade networks.
