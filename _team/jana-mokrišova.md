Jana is a research associate for ‘Being an Islander: Art and Identity of the Large Mediterranean Islands’ research and exhibition project. Jana’s research specialises in the archaeology of western Anatolia and the eastern Aegean from the Late Bronze Age to the Archaic period and theoretical approaches to ancient mobility in the Mediterranean. She holds a PhD in Classical Art and Archaeology (University of Michigan).

Her new research develops particular aspects of ancient mobilities, such as the application of landscape approaches (as part of MIGMAG: Migration and the Making of the Ancient Greek World’ directed by Prof. Naoíse Mac Sweeney, University of Vienna) and issues of technological transfer with a particular focus on the role of iron (as part of ’Project Sideros: Early Iron Technology and Culture History in the Aegean during the Early Iron Age’, directed by Dr Marek Verčík, Charles University, Prague).

While Jana’s primary research is in Turkey, she was a part of excavation and survey projects in Greece, Italy, the Republic of Georgia, Bulgaria, and the USA. Before coming to Cambridge, Jana taught at Sheffield (2017) and was Lecturer in Ancient Greek History and Archaeology at Birkbeck, University of London (2018-2020).
