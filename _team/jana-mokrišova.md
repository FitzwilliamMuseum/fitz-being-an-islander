Jana is an archaeologist specialising in western Anatolia and the eastern Aegean from the Late Bronze Age to the Archaic period and theoretical approaches to ancient mobility. She holds a PhD in Classical Art and Archaeology (University of Michigan) and a BA from Trent University (Ontario, Canada). At Cambridge, she is Research Associate for ‘MIGMAG: Migration and the Making of the Ancient Greek World’ (ERC Consolidator Grant; Prof. Naoíse Mac Sweeney, University of Vienna).

Jana's research investigates the connections between mobility, cultural exchange, and identity from methodological perspectives and applies it to western Anatolia and the Aegean. Her PhD project brought forth a new theoretical and methodological understanding of ancient mobilities by re-examining whether the period after the collapse of Late Bronze Age polities witnessed an increase of unidirectional movement from Greece and the Aegean into western Anatolia. During her PhD, she was John L. Caskey Fellow (regular member) at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (2012-2013) and Junior Fellow at the Koç University’s Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations, Istanbul (2015-2016).

Her new research develops particular aspects of ancient mobilities, such as the application of landscape approaches (as part of MIGMAG) and issues of technological transfer with a particular focus on the role of iron (as part of ’Project Sideros: Early Iron Technology and Culture History in the Aegean during the Early Iron Age’, directed by Dr Marek Verčík, Charles University, Prague). She is also a research associate for ‘Being an Islander: Art and Identity of the Large Mediterranean Islands’ research and exhibition project at the Fitzwilliam Museum (directed by Dr Anastasia Christophilopoulou).

While Jana's primary research is in Turkey, she was a part of excavation and survey projects in Greece, Italy, the Republic of Georgia, Bulgaria, and the USA. Before coming to Cambridge, Jana taught at Sheffield (2017) and was Lecturer in Ancient Greek History and Archaeology at Birkbeck, University of London (2018-2020). Her teaching focuses on cultural interaction and mobility in the ancient Mediterranean and incorporates methodological and theoretical perspectives from anthropology, archaeology, and history to studying the past.
