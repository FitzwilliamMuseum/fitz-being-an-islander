In his dual role at the Hellenic Institute (HI) and the Centre for Greek Diaspora Studies (CGDS), Achilleas is responsible for the development of international and interdisciplinary research on the modern history of Hellenic migration. He facilitates the creation of synergies between internal and external partners and the implementation of the HI’s and the CGDS’ public engagement strategy which aims to bring academic knowledge on diasporas closer to migrant communities.

Achilleas holds a PhD from the European University Institute in Florence and has published in the areas of contemporary Greek history and culture. Over the past years, through his previous capacity as the Cultural Counsellor of the Cyprus High Commission in London (2014-18), he has developed a strong interest in the study of the history, identity and culture of Greek and Cypriot diasporas around the world. Before joining RHUL, he taught in universities in Cyprus and also worked in roles outside the academia in Cyprus and the UK. These roles provided him with experience in teaching, scientific project management, diplomacy and public engagement.

Beyond his academic interests, Achilleas is currently exploring possible intersections of positive sciences (especially theoretical physics and cosmology) with practical philosophy.
