Growing up in Cyprus, the deep history and archaeology of the island created a huge impact in my experiences as a kid and a young adult. After finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree on Archaeology and History of Art in the Aristotle University, Greece, I moved in Cambridge for an MPhil. My dissertation focused on the deathways of a community in Prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus for addressing questions on elites and communal politics.  Moreover, throughout my years of studying, I have participated in numerous archaeological projects, both excavations and surveys, in Greece and Cyprus.  as well as a number of workshops related to ceramics, ceramic technology and petrography.
