As Assistant Director, I co-ordinate the BSA courses and teaching for both undergraduate and graduate students, and I manage the security and maintenance of the Athens hostel. I serve as Curator of the BSA museum, and I also contribute to the Archaeology in Greece Online project.

My research follows two main tracks. First, I am investigating networking between Archaic and Classical period city-states, using GIS and quantitative analysis to learn more about ancient communities’ political and economic interactions. This work builds on the PhD thesis that I completed at the University of Cambridge. Second, I use tools from the Digital Humanities on large or archival archaeological datasets, looking for new patterns of historical interest in old material.

I currently participate in the Palace of Nestor Excavations (Pylos) as a GIS and 3d visualisation specialist. Furthermore, in collaboration with Anastasia Christophilopoulou, Naoíse Mac Sweeney and Jana Mokrišová, we are currently investigating the west area of Samos in a BSA sponsored field project.
